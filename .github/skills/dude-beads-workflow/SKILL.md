# Beads Workflow

Standard workflow for all Dude specialists when working on tasks tracked in Beads. This skill applies only after Beads import; when Beads is unavailable or intentionally not used, load `dude-lightweight-execution` instead.

## Coordinator Handoff

- `@dude track` normally resumes in-progress work first.
- Before selecting new work, the coordinator may import defined brainstorms whose `spec_path` is not yet represented in Beads.
- When tracked execution is active, `@dude status` reports Beads state and defined features waiting for execution, but it must not import or mutate work.
- If tracked execution is being enabled on Windows and Beads is not initialized yet, point the user to the Dolt server-mode setup instead of retrying plain `bd init` after embedded-Dolt or CGO failures.

## Feature Lifecycle After Import

- A feature's identity is the brainstorm `spec_path:` value (full path to `spec.md`, e.g. `specs/001-feature-name/spec.md`). Every Beads issue imported from that feature carries the same value as a `spec:` prefix in the first line of its description. See `dude-spec-import-to-beads` for the canonical-identity rule.
- A feature is considered `imported` when at least one Beads issue has a description starting with `spec: <spec_path>` matching the brainstorm's `spec_path` (literal match).
- A feature is considered `active` when it currently has ready or in-progress Beads work.
- After import, Beads is the live board and source of truth.
- After import, `tasks.md` is not used for readiness or completion decisions. It may be kept as a one-way, non-authoritative portability mirror of Beads state so the feature can later be reconciled back to Lightweight Execution.

## Beads-To-Markdown Mirror

The mirror is one-way: Beads -> `tasks.md`. While tracked execution is active, never use `tasks.md` to override Beads.

Throughout this skill, an **executable Beads issue** is one whose Beads `type` is not `epic`. Non-executable grouping issues — specifically the deferred feature epic created by `dude-spec-import-to-beads` and any other `type=epic` issue — never participate in mirror writes or mirror verification. A **representable** issue is an executable issue whose Beads status maps to a markdown glyph in the table below; deferred executable issues are reportable as `unsupported` but are not silently mirrored.

When the coordinator changes Beads execution state, mirror the result to the matching canonical task unit in `specs/<feature>/tasks.md` when all of these are true:

- the Beads issue description starts with `spec: <spec_path>`
- the issue is executable (see definition above)
- exactly one canonical task header in that feature's `tasks.md` matches the Beads issue by one of the following channels, evaluated in this order:
  1. **durable key** — the Beads issue title or description contains an original task key such as `T012@a1b2c3d4`, and exactly one task header carries the same durable key
  2. **Beads tag** — exactly one task header in the feature's `tasks.md` carries a previously generated `(Beads: <id>)` tag whose `<id>` is the closed/updated Beads issue ID (recognized by the regex `\(Beads:\s*([A-Za-z0-9_-]+)(?:\s*;[^)]*)?\)`)

Mirror status mapping:

| Beads status | Markdown glyph |
|--------------|----------------|
| `open` | `[ ]` |
| `in_progress` | `[~]` |
| `blocked` | `[!]` |
| `closed` | `[x]` |
| `deferred` | skip grouping issues; report executable issues as unsupported |

`deferred` is reserved by Dude for non-executable grouping issues such as the feature epic created by `dude-spec-import-to-beads`. Those issues do not correspond to any canonical task header in `tasks.md`, so mirror skips them silently and does not report them as ambiguous. If an executable task is deferred in Beads, do not silently drop it: report it as unsupported by the current markdown glyph set and ask whether to keep it only in Beads, reopen it, or represent it as blocked.

Mirror only the task-state glyph and Beads-derived blocker metadata when needed. Preserve the task key, labels, description, explicit `deps:`, and human-authored task text. If a generated board region is present, regenerate it as a complete replacement from the canonical task units.

Append a concise line to the companion brainstorm's `## Coordinator Log` for every successful mirror write or sync-driven append. Use one of these stable forms (timestamp is ISO local time):

```text
2026-05-19 14:22 — mirrored Beads close dude-abc to tasks.md T012@a1b2c3d4
2026-05-19 14:23 — mirrored Beads status in_progress dude-def to tasks.md T013@77aa11bb
2026-05-19 14:24 — appended discovered Beads issue dude-xyz to tasks.md as T9001@4f2a91c0
2026-05-19 14:25 — sync reported mirror drift: 2 stale, 0 ambiguous, 1 unsupported
```

Report-only entries (the last form) are appended only by explicit `@dude sync` runs that surface drift, never by `@dude status`.

After mutating `tasks.md`, run the `dude-lint` skill (`pwsh .github/skills/dude-lint/lint.ps1` or `bash .github/skills/dude-lint/lint.sh`) and fix any `[FAIL]` before reporting the mirror as successful.

If the task key is missing, `tasks.md` is missing, the key maps to zero or multiple task headers, the board fence is malformed, or the companion brainstorm cannot be identified, do not guess. Keep the Beads state as authoritative, report that the Beads operation succeeded but markdown mirroring was skipped, and ask the user to run an explicit Beads-to-markdown sync or reconcile the task identity.

`@dude sync Beads to tasks.md` is the explicit reconciliation command for manual Beads changes, machine switching, or stale mirrors. It scans Beads issues by `spec:` prefix, applies the status mapping above to every unambiguous task key, regenerates the board region, appends Coordinator Log entries, runs `dude-lint`, and reports imported, mirrored, skipped, ambiguous, unsupported, and appended counts. It is mutating and must not run as part of `@dude status`.

### Discovered Beads Work

Beads issues created mid-flight (for example with `bd create ... --deps discovered-from:<id>`) carry a `spec:` prefix but have no matching task header in `tasks.md` until the first sync. The close-time auto-mirror never appends new headers; once a discovered issue has been surfaced by `@dude sync Beads to tasks.md`, however, the `(Beads: <id>)` tag arm of the mirror match rules above lets later close-time mirror writes update that appended header (for example, flipping it to `[x]` when the discovered Beads issue closes).

`@dude sync Beads to tasks.md` is the only path that surfaces discovered work in `tasks.md`. When the sync finds an executable open, in-progress, or blocked Beads issue with a `spec:` prefix and no matching durable key or previously generated `(Beads: <id>)` tag in that feature's `tasks.md`, it appends a new canonical task unit under a `## Discovered During Execution` section (creating that section if it does not yet exist). If `## Lightweight Execution History` is present, insert `## Discovered During Execution` immediately above it; otherwise append `## Discovered During Execution` as the final section in the file. The history block, when present, must remain the terminal archive section. The appended unit must use the normal task-header schema so `dude-lint`, Lightweight Execution, and future imports still understand it:

- TNNN is allocated from the **reserved discovered range `T9001`–`T9999`**, using the next free integer above the highest existing `T9NNN` header in that file (start at `T9001` when none exists). Spec-derived tasks emitted by `dude-feature-definition` stay below `T9000`, so re-defining the feature cannot collide with appended discovered work.
- the durable suffix is **the first 8 hex characters of `sha256(<beads-id>)` (lowercase)** — this is a rule, not an example, so two machines syncing the same Beads database always produce the same header. On the rare event of a collision against an existing suffix in the same file, append `-1`, `-2`, ... to the Beads ID input before hashing and record the salt in the matching parenthetical (e.g. `Beads: dude-xyz; suffix-salt: 1`).
- `[Shared]` as the story label unless the Beads issue unambiguously maps to a specific user story
- the Beads issue title as the task text, ending with a stable `(Beads: <id>)` tag and, when present, `; discovered from: <parent-id>` inside the same parenthetical
- the original status glyph from the mapping above

Do not introduce a separate `D...` task namespace or new metadata keys such as `discovered-from:`; those are not part of the canonical task format. The generated `(Beads: <id>)` tag is the future matching anchor when the Beads issue itself still lacks a generated task key, and the close-time mirror match rules above explicitly accept it as the third match channel.

The sync report lists every appended entry separately from regular mirror writes so the user can keep, retitle, or remove them before continuing. Closed Beads issues with no matching task header are reported as skipped rather than appended, because back-filling completed history into `tasks.md` is the user's decision.

### Mirror Verification

`@dude status` is read-only and does not perform a sync. When tracked execution is active, treat the mirror line as a trustworthy portability check, not a cheap mtime hint. Query Beads with `bd list --json`, group issues by `spec:` prefix, read the matching `tasks.md`, and verify the markdown snapshot against Beads without writing anything.

- `Mirror: verified current` when every executable, representable Beads issue for the feature maps to exactly one canonical task header by durable task key or generated `(Beads: <id>)` tag, and each mapped header has the glyph required by the status mapping above
- `Mirror: stale — run @dude sync Beads to tasks.md` when any executable open, in-progress, blocked, or closed Beads issue is missing from `tasks.md`, maps ambiguously, or has a mismatched glyph
- `Mirror: unsupported — deferred executable Beads task <id>` when the feature contains a deferred executable issue that cannot be represented by the current markdown glyph set
- `Mirror: not present` when no `tasks.md` exists for the active feature
- `Mirror: unknown — <reason>` when Beads or the filesystem cannot be read well enough to verify the snapshot

When more than one condition would apply for a single feature, report the most actionable one in this priority order: `unknown` > `stale` > `unsupported` > `not present` > `verified current`. Additional non-actionable conditions for the same feature may be appended as a secondary `Mirror notes:` line so nothing is hidden.

Non-executable grouping issues, including deferred epics, do not participate in mirror verification. The check is informational but must be accurate: do not report `verified current` from file modification times alone.

## Before Starting Work

```bash
# Find your next task (coordinator usually tells you, but you can check)
bd ready --json --limit 5
```

Ignore epics or other non-executable grouping issues if they appear in the ready output.

## Claiming a Task

Always claim before starting. This is atomic — prevents two agents from working on the same task.

```bash
bd update <id> --claim --json
```

If the claim fails (someone else got it first), pick the next ready task.

## Reading Context

Every imported bead has a `spec:` line as the first line of its description — the workspace-relative path to the feature's `spec.md`. Always read it before starting:

```bash
bd show <id> --json
# → parse the first line of description for "spec: <path>" → read that spec.md file for acceptance criteria, plan, and contracts
```

Also check for related context:

- `specs/<feature>/plan.md` — technical architecture
- `specs/<feature>/contracts/` — API contracts, schemas
- `specs/<feature>/data-model.md` — entity definitions

## During Work

If you discover a bug, missing requirement, or new task while working:

```bash
bd create "<title>" -t bug -p <priority> --deps discovered-from:<current-task-id> --json
```

The `discovered-from` link maintains traceability. The new bead enters the ready queue after the current task closes.

## Blockage Escalation

If your work is blocked by a problem in the spec, plan, contracts, or architecture — not just a new task — escalate to the coordinator instead of working around it:

1. Create a Beads issue describing the blockage:
   ```bash
   bd create "Spec gap: <description>" -t bug -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<current-task-id> --json
   ```
2. Block your current task:
   ```bash
   bd update <current-task-id> --status blocked --json
   ```
3. Report to the coordinator with a structured return:
   - what was attempted
   - what failed or is missing
   - **blockage type**: `spec-gap` | `plan-gap` | `contract-mismatch` | `test-failure` | `external-dependency`
   - the created Beads issue ID

The coordinator triages by blockage type and routes to the right specialist for resolution. Do not try to fix spec, plan, or contract problems yourself — those artifacts belong to other specialists.

## Completing a Task

Use this completion pipeline:

1. The implementation specialist reports what changed and what was verified.
2. `@dude-tester` validates the work when verification is relevant or required.
3. `@dude-reviewer` provides independent readiness judgment when that role is present or requested.
4. Only then does the coordinator decide whether to call `bd close`.

When your work is done, **report results to the coordinator**. Do not call `bd close` yourself — the coordinator owns the close decision so the delivery pipeline (verification, review) can run first.

Return to the coordinator:

- what was done
- what was verified
- blockers or follow-up items discovered

The coordinator calls `bd close` after the pipeline completes:

```bash
bd close <id> --reason "Completed: <one-line summary of what was done>" --json
```

This automatically unblocks any tasks that were waiting on this one.

After `bd close` succeeds, the coordinator must run the Beads-to-markdown mirror for the closed issue before reporting completion. The mirror updates the matching canonical task header in `tasks.md` to `[x]`, refreshes the derived board region when present, records the sync in the brainstorm Coordinator Log, and runs `dude-lint`. If mirroring cannot be completed safely, report the skipped mirror separately from the successful Beads close.

## Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `open` | Ready to be claimed |
| `in_progress` | Claimed, being worked on |
| `blocked` | Waiting on another task |
| `deferred` | Intentionally postponed |
| `closed` | Done |

## Priority Values

| Priority | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| 0 | Critical — security, data loss, broken builds |
| 1 | High — major features, important bugs |
| 2 | Medium — standard work |
| 3 | Low — polish, optimization |
| 4 | Backlog — future ideas |

## Rules

- Always use `--json` flag for reliable output parsing.
- Never create tasks outside Beads — it is the single source of truth while tracked execution is active.
- Do not read `tasks.md` as the live board after import. It may only receive Beads-derived mirror updates or explicit Beads-to-markdown sync results.
- Always claim before working — never skip the claim step.
- Do not call `bd close` yourself — report results to the coordinator, who owns the close decision.
- Ignore epics or other grouping issues in `bd ready` output; they are not executable tasks.
- If you can't complete a task, update its status: `bd update <id> --status blocked --json`

## Ready Work Loop

1. Query `bd ready --json`.
2. Filter out epics or other non-executable grouping issues.
3. Pick one or more safe tasks.
4. Execute and validate.
5. Report results to the coordinator.
6. Query ready work again.

### Continuous Work

When the user invokes `@dude work` while Tracked Execution is the active lane, load `dude-work` and let it drive the ready loop above. The claim discipline (`bd update <id> --claim --json`), the coordinator-only close decision (`bd close`), the Beads Close Protocol, the markdown mirror, and `dude-lint` after each write all still apply per iteration. The default cap is `--max 3`. See `dude-work` for the full grammar and stop conditions.
